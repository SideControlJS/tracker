## Description

This application is a MERN stack-based issue tracker, designed to manage and track issues within various rooms and associated devices (targeted for hospitality/construction management). It provides functionality to report issues, categorize them, and monitor their resolution status through a web interface. Users can create and view rooms, list devices within those rooms, and report issues related to specific devices. The application facilitates efficient tracking and handling of maintenance tasks, improving operational workflows.
